""" Yin Pitch Estimation Algorithm

This is a fully-vectorized implementation of the Yin pitch estimation
algorithm for PyTorch. It is based on the excellent NumPy baseline by
Patrice Guyot (github.com/patriceguyot), with changes for batching and
vectorization of the iterative search.

    """estimate the pitch (fundamental frequency) of a signal

    This function attempts to determine the pitch of a signal via the
    Yin algorithm. Accuracy can be improved by sampling the signal at a
    higher rate, especially for higher-frequency pitches, and by narrowing
    the values of pitch_min and pitch_max. For example, good values for
    speech signals are pitch_min=60 and pitch_max=500. frame_stride can also
    be tuned to the expected minimum rate of pitch change of the signal:
    10ms is commonly used for speech.

    The speed and memory usage of the algorithm are also determined by the
    pitch_min parameter, which is used to window the audio signal into
    2*sample_rate/pitch_min sliding windows. A higher pitch_min corresponds to
    less memory usage and faster running time.

    Args:
        signal: the signal vector (1D) or [batch, time] tensor to analyze
        sample_rate: sample rate, in Hz, of the signal
        pitch_min: expected lower bound of the pitch
        pitch_max: expected upper bound of the pitch
        frame_stride: overlapping window stride, in seconds, which determines
            the number of pitch values returned
        threshold: harmonic threshold value (see paper)

    Returns:
        pitch: PyTorch tensor of pitch estimations, one for each frame of
            the windowed signal, an entry of 0 corresponds to a non-periodic
            frame, where no periodic signal was detected
